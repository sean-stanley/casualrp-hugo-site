      <description>&amp;ldquo;Have you seen a blue skinned giant around, might go by the name of Cor?&amp;rdquo;
Whispers in the night of homes so far away Thunder rumbles making light Through storms they must survey
Pursuit paddles powerfully splashing &amp;lsquo;wards the fray Giant hidden sourly For friends he did not say

Swallowed by the swamp the earth bubbled and boiled The horned leech goes chomp Ser Selwyn&amp;rsquo;s fortune spoiled
To fight a foe unseen or flee while they still may report to the machine whilst all in disarray

      <description>When the moon rises the balance changes Like the foaming caps at sea Now we gather all together to cast our spell of three
With hands so linked and guests asleep we stealth down wooden stairs To work our art upon their minds to change what&amp;rsquo;s written there Just three we&amp;rsquo;ll take for slavery we&amp;rsquo;ll send them to their misery
We&amp;rsquo;ll make them pay with their long lives, insults we won&amp;rsquo;t forget For blood of servants spilled above and plans that lost their threat How ignorant they still remain of injuries they&amp;rsquo;ve dealt</description>

      <description>Chapter 3: Heart of the Jungle was about finding the literal heart of the jungle as well as dealing with the characters feelings and romantic entanglements.
When they went into the drow caves and travelled beneath the jungle, this was in one way the literal heart of the jungle. And when they found Orcosh and Ghelgec, two significant places to orcs, these were spiritual and cultural hearts of the jungle. Many times the players had to choose to follow their hearts or follow their heads, and many times the players’ choice was passion over reason.</description>

Tactic after tactic is tried to defeat this abomination ending in one party member blind and another comatose in nightmares&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Selwyn &amp;amp; Leila take a trip to the Kronus&amp;rsquo;s farm to try to convince the widow there to let her son join the Craftsmen. Meanwhile Ash takes Cor to a shrine to show him the deities of Shinrin. Cor isn&amp;rsquo;t much impressed. That evening, Leila&amp;rsquo;s friends are keen to meet Cor, for some reason, while Ash brags about becoming a Craftsman to the other guards. Their evening is interrupted by a gang of orcs called the Blackhearts looking for a fight.</description>

      <description>We didn&amp;rsquo;t start this campaign as a podcast. We played for a few weeks and then decided to get a mic, make some posts and record our sessions. This is a special episode of us recapping what everyone did before the podcast&amp;rsquo;s start. Its a great way to meet the characters, meet the players, and catch up on the story so far.</description>
