A dangerous foe finally falls. The priest wants to know what's going on and so does the rest of the town. With their current quests coming to a close, the party discusses their future. They make plans to form a new mercenary company as they enjoy the luxurious home of the captain of the Craftsman. The following morning, is a grim day as national hatred delivers harsh justice to foreigners. Ser Selwyn is honoured for everyone's victories and even gains a promotion. But the bloodthirsty justice and angry mob is overwhelming for some and so they start a hasty retreat into the jungle towards home.
