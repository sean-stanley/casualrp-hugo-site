A grey puddle of acidic death is slowly advancing on the group and seems bent on devouring their flesh and their equipment. Arrows and swords and even Ash's fire seem to matter little to it. And as Cor casts a spell at it, he feels it flung back at himself nearly full force by the alien, unknowable psyche in that quasi-sentient slime. Tactic after tactic is tried to defeat this abomination ending in one party member blind and another comatose in nightmares...
