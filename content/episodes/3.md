After the bar fight, Ser Selwyn talks to the guard about what to do with the Blackheart Orcs. Meanwhile Leila's friends give her some advice on how to politically manage the situation. Ser Selwyn then goes over the details of the plan to retrieve the settlers with his superiors. They rest and rise extra early to depart Shinrin for the wild trails of the jungle.
