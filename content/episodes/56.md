The party sets out on the underground river, safe from the monsters in the jungle above they have a completely peaceful and event-free journey -- for the first two hours. Ash and Stephanos are relaxing and fishing when the party begins being pulled into the glowing depths by fowl creatures from the maddening deeps. And not everyone on the boat is alive at the end of the episode. But Cor sure knows how to ruin a funeral.
