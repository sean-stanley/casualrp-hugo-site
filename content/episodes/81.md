Half woman-half-deer she stalks the feywild with her mystic moon wolf at her heels. With untamed explosions of power, this tiny, black-winged gentleman packs a bang. With scales like sapphires and swirling golden, eyes, rich plumage and polished bronze armour, this noble draconic knight is dedicated to the summer court. The monk's beloved Sundew wishes to leave the feywild. To do so she must complete a painful ritual that begins with collecting the most dangerous substance to fey, iron.
