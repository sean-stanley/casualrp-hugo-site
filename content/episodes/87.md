Death by perfume. To fight the beasts or flee, that is the question. Ash has nearly everything he needs for his ritual. Ser Selwyn considers turning back and at lunch Cor shares out his prisoners. Leila cannot shake the feeling of being watched. As evening arrives the lovely Polly invites the party back to her house offering all the comforts of civilisation.

The balance grows and shifts and tilts
Here her wicked call
Beware the witches house on stilts
For fate will crush you all
