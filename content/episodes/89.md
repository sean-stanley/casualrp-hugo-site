When the moon rises the balance changes
Like the foaming caps at sea
Now we gather all together to cast our spell of three

With hands so linked and guests asleep we stealth down wooden stairs
To work our art upon their minds to change what's written there
Just three we'll take for slavery we'll send them to their misery

We'll make them pay with their long lives, insults we won't forget
For blood of servants spilled above and plans that lost their threat
How ignorant they still remain of injuries they've dealt

Changers, shifters, balance bound we loose on you your death
But three is all we need to cast and yet they come with five.
A shame about the rescued lad for him we didn't mind.
