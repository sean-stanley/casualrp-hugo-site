Do you really get paid double to use a greatsword? Maybe if you're a human... A cold war starts getting pretty hot and the party is in the thick of it. A witch is on the loose, hiding out with someone safe. Until the players raid the church looking for her. Dark powers based on oaths and bonds threaten to overwhelm the party. Are their own bonds strong enough to overcome the faith of the Raven Queen's chosen one?
