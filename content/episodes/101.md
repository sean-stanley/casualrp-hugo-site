What was supposed to be a relaxing evening full of the pleasures of civilization begins to get out of hand. Ser Selwyn doesn't trust the Craftsmen who claim they want to help him get Lord Shimoda home. Leila and Endre illegally update their wardrobe, and Cor tries to keep his Firbolg friends safe while they are offended at what the humans eat. Ash, with a special cup from the Dark Elves, wins a drinking contest but then spills the party's secrets.
