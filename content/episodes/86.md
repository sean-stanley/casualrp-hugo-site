A migration... of sorts. Reptiles swimming and flying with purpose to an unknown destination. Ash begins gathering ingredients for his dark ritual, while Leila and Endre gather new and exotic jungle foods. Cor interprets the signs and portents for the party while Ser Selwyn tries to keep the party on task.

For trauma, fear and pain can stay our reaching hand
From grasping out at stretching far to pluck the nuts of gold
Our greed for riches, drive for love battles with the past
To trust our fear and stay away or brave it risk grow cold.
