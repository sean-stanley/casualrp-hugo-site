Jealousy that has been seething beneath the surface finally comes to a head in the party. The dark elves begin to make plans with the characters to continue their journey but those not welcome at their private meeting find other ways to entertain themselves. They also learn of a dangerous yet intriguing sport played by their hosts and are invited to join in.
