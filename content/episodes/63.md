Chocolat smuggled out of House Sociale is shared after a harrowing encounter with dangerous waters. But the sweet chocolatey treat is more than it appears and as the players begin packing to leave the drow behind, plots are set in motion that reveal the true depths of trickery drow are capable of. Ash bonds with his tiny dragon some more.
