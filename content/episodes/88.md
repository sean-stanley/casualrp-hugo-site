Meet Polly, Nanny and Granny. Three women who live in a hut in a swamp. They are friendly, curious and can read your mind. They're hut and Nanny and Granny shine with powerful magic, and so does that wheel on the wall. They say it twists and turns as the Balance shifts. Their loom is working all on it's own, weaving a tapestry of... something.

Dance like the maiden
Laugh like the mother
Think like the crone
