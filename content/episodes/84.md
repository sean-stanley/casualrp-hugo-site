The woman from Endelee is coming right here.
She'll claw you and kill all of those you hold dear.
She's noble, she's mad and she's magical too.
There's no hiding, no crying, that will all get you through.

Herded and crowded like lambs to the slaughter
The woman from Endelee will chase you with laughter
For her nails their polished and shining so bright
To claw and to rend you, make you scream through the night.
