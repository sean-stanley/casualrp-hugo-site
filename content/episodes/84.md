The woman from Endelee is coming right here, she'll claw you and kill all of those you hold dear. She's noble, she's mad and she's magical too, there's no hiding, no crying, that will all get you through.

Herded and crowded like lambs to the slaughter, the woman from Endelee will chase you with laughter. For her nails are polished and shining so bright, to claw and to rend you, make you scream through the night.
