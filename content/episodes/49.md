The outgoing Drow houses give the players a warm welcome. They offer them fine food, entertainment and un-restricted access to their fancy jungle booze. When the party finally decides to retire though, some of the party members find their lavish guest rooms include a type of room service they definitely were not expecting or wanting.

Many of the events were inspired by the twitch chat room for this episode. Thanks so much to everyone who joined us. You helped make the game so great.
