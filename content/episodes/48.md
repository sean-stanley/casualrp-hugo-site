The party somewhat unwillingly makes a deal with the drow and follows them to another family's abode. Leila is given part-payment upfront for her new job. Ash competes with Drow over dance and musical ability, Cor is treated with much suspicion, and Ser Selwyn is finally able to start drinking again.
