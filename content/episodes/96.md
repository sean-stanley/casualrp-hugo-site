Paddling down the winding jungle river, life is all around. Ash finishes his latest carving project, Ser Selwyn talks about retirement, Cor takes the slowest boat and Leila and Endre stay alert for danger in the lead. Trouble is right around the bend, bad weather and bad company come out of seemingly nowhere to put a stop to this gentle river journey.
