An outcast, cultist, folk-hero & lycan are caught between an ancient curse and the frozen tundra. Now THIS is Casual RP.

This was a Casual RP Christmas Special Interlude talking place in the snowy continent of Hildurn with Jasher Drake as the Dungeon Master and Caleb, Hamish, Sean & Hope as the players.
