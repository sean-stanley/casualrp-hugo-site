Selwyn & Leila take a trip to the Kronus's farm to try to convince the widow there to let her son join the Craftsmen. Meanwhile Ash takes Cor to a shrine to show him the deities of Shinrin. Cor isn't much impressed. That evening, Leila's friends are keen to meet Cor, for some reason, while Ash brags about becoming a Craftsman to the other guards. Their evening is interrupted by a gang of orcs called the Blackhearts looking for a fight.
