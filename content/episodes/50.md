Ser Selwyn, Leila and Stephanos all have to think quick to avoid offending their very eager night-time visitors. The aftermath of their plans though cause disrupted sleep for the entire party. Before the totally smashed Ash can sleep though, he has to take care of his little dragon friend -- who is not happy about being ignored and trapped in a box all day.

Many of the events were inspired by the twitch chat room for this episode. Thanks so much to everyone who joined us. You helped make the game so great.
