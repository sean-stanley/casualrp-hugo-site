Returning to the drow to retrieve their boats is an opportunity to see friends again. But for Gulfi Sosial it's an opportunity for revenge and to impress the spider goddess Lolth. Ser Selwyn refuses to help as do Cor and Ash. When Cor invites Captain Zolgos, the drow who poisoned Gulfi, to meet and see Gulfi again, they force a confrontation between soldier and fallen priestess.
