Hastily leaving town, the party is spotted by smugglers with a score to settle. Endre tries to spoil their ambush but the smuggler has some unexpected firepower. They're not interested in negotiating, only in collecting blood, but Ser Selwyn, Leila, Cor and Ash are not the pushovers they were when they last crossed the smugglers. After settling their score, everyone realizes they've forgotten something rather important.
