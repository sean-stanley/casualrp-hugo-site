After their tiger hunting trip, the party spends the evening dining with Lord Jacku and Lady Jiru Shinrin. The next morning they enjoy bacon in the servant's kitchen before slipping out and splitting up to do town jobs. Ser Selwyn and Leila visit Ser Thomas while Cor and Ash go shopping for supplies with their new-found wealth. They learn about a job escorting new settlers to Shinrin and decide to take it.
