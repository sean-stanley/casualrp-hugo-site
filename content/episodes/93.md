Nabulee el Jasafir is a merchant from the desert city of Calimport, who owns a small auction house in Waterdeep. His business is buying enchanted items that adventurers recover from the ruins of FaeruÌ‚n, and reselling them to the highest bidder. Over the years, he made quite a reputation for himself, and many Waterdhavian notables now spend fortunes on his magical trinkets as a means of showing their wealth and status. When a young noble dies from a cursed item a block away, the investigation begins!
