The woman from Endelee delights in your torture
No metal nor spell will be able to touch her
Her victims are legion
Her breath is harsh poison
In pain she's your teacher
she'll give you a lesson

What can you do to avoid my detection
Can you run can you hide
There's one thing you've forgotten
The smell of your fear
it grows ever stronger
And the hunt my poor dears
Makes my pleasure last longer
