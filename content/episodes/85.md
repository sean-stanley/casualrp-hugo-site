The woman from Endelee delights in your torture, no metal nor spell will be able to touch her. Her victims are legion, her breath is harsh poison, in pain she's your teacher, she'll give you a lesson.

What can you do to avoid my detection, can you run, can you hide? There's one thing you've forgotten, the smell of your fear grows ever stronger. And the hunt my poor dears makes my pleasure last longer.
