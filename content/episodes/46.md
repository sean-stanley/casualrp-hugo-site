After gathering up the dragon’s hoard the party descends out of the kobold’s den back to the river below. They then proceed to discuss what their next move will be; to head back to Shinrin, or to continue searching for the missing people. But as the current sweeps the group deeper into the jungle, the companions are met with familiar sights and a familiar group...

This is the finale of Chapter 2, but we’ll be back in a couple of weeks with the premiere of Chapter 3!
