Chapter 3: Heart of the Jungle was about finding the literal heart of the jungle as well as dealing with the characters feelings and romantic entanglements.

When they went into the drow caves and travelled beneath the jungle, this was in one way the literal heart of the jungle. And when they found Orcosh and Ghelgec, two significant places to orcs, these were spiritual and cultural hearts of the jungle. Many times the players had to choose to follow their hearts or follow their heads, and many times the players’ choice was passion over reason. Greed, rage and grief were all powerful drivers in the last chapter as deals were made with drow, old orcs were murdered for revenge and Leila’s friend Stephanos was turned into a stone statue.

In terms of romance, Stephanos became jealous of the party being friendly with Leila, and a drow priestess fell in love with Ser Selwyn and pursued him for the entire chapter. Ash tried to tame and befriend the tiny dragon Crimson. Cor expected nothing but bullying and betrayal with the Drow but a young arrogant princess instead latched onto him and insisted on taking his arm.

And so now moving on to chapter 4. Ser Selwyn spurned Gulfi yet again. Leila has lost her friend Stephanos but is reunited with handsome and charming Endre. They are heading back to civilisation, their discoveries and treasures in tow. But their actions in the jungle will have lasting consequences. The wheel of balance has shifted.
