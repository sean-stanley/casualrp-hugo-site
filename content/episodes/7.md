The party finds themselves caught in the middle of someone else's battle. Some humans with terrible fashion sense are being pursued by brightly coloured frog-people. The humans seek refuge with the party while the frog people attack indiscriminately. Cor however near the end of the fight decides to take the humans prisoner and the party then tries to figure out what to do with them.
