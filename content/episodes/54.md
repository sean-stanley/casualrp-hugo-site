The warriors lounge is a special club for Dark Elf Warriors, Selwyn in his new armor, takes every drink and pill offered him while the scintillating scented smokes of silver censures smear the ceiling. Leila sweats out the skunk stench and gains a new magical odour to replace it. Ash nearly gets smooched by smooches and Cor picks up a girl.
