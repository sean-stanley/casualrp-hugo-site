They've reached the ocean and are on their way to civilization again. But first while they pack up camp, Ash slips away to conduct a dark ritual, sending 20 words across the void and receiving an incomplete message back. Endre wants allies to conduct his mischief and Leila begins spying on the party again. Ser Selwyn comes up with a plan for keeping the young lord hidden and Cor falls back on his pranking ways on his fellow firbolgs.
