Ask a tree which way to go? Trust your party member? Ask the gods! The party is getting anxious to rescue their lost friends and can't decide which way to go. Eventually stumbling into the jungle to search. Cor drops the boat, Ser Selwyn gets a new nickname, Ash goes nuts and Leila tracks what she hopes is a clue and not certain doom.
