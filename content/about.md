The Jungle Campaign follows a boy, guard, thief and giant as they are caught between the wild cries of the jungle and the hammers of industry.

Originally The Jungle Campaign began with Sean running a home game for Travis, Jasher, Hamish, Caleb, and Hope, but eventually it evolved into a D&D real-play podcast.
